 This app was mainly generated by using claude.ai

 I ran 'docker compose up -d'

 and also added this config to traefik for it to work:

 ```
 http:
  routers:
    stayinginbern:
        entryPoints: web-secure
        rule: Host(`stayinginbern.ch`)
        service: stayinginbern-service
        tls:
            certResolver: default

  services:
    stayinginbern-service:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://172.17.0.1:8888"  # Docker host IP
 ```
